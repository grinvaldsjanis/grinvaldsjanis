From a young age, I was always fascinated by technology and the incredible things it could do. Even though I was curious about programming and the ability to create digital products, I never really thought I would become a programmer myself. Instead, I started exploring my interests in 3D modeling, design, and architecture. I have also worked on some web projects as a product owner and technical director.

I am relatively new to programming, but I have gained some experience in HTML, CSS, Typescript, React, Next.js, and some of the React libraries and CSS frameworks. Although my experience is limited, I am eager to learn more and to apply my creativity and problem-solving skills to new programming challenges.

My experience in 3D modeling, design, and architecture has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and creativity. I've learned to think spatially and visualize complex systems, which has been helpful in designing user interfaces and working with web layouts. Additionally, my background in architecture has taught me to think systematically and design things in a modular, scalable way.
