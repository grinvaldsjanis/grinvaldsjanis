### About me
From a young age, I've been fascinated by technology and its boundless potential. Although I never expected to become a programmer, my curiosity in digital product creation led me to explore my interests in 3D modeling, design, and architecture. I've also gained experience working as a product owner and technical director on some web projects.

While I'm relatively new to programming, I've learned HTML, CSS, Typescript, React, Next.js, and various React libraries and CSS frameworks. I'm eager to expand my skills and apply my creativity and problem-solving abilities to new programming challenges. Apart from web development, I'm also enthusiastic about mobile development and have started learning Flutter to gain more experience and create innovative mobile apps.

My experience in 3D modeling, design, and architecture provides me with a unique problem-solving perspective and creative approach. I've honed my spatial thinking and visualization skills, which prove helpful in designing user interfaces and web layouts. Moreover, my background in architecture has taught me to think systematically and design modular, scalable systems.
